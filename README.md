# omnichromacy

Omnichromacy is a library (work in progress) for anlayzing and visualizing
multispectral and hyperspectral data, intended for geographic data sources
typically collected aerially or by satellite.

Most human beings are trichromats, but through the magic contained in this
Clojure library you can overcome your biological limitations and analyze
and visualize combinations of colors outside the visual spectrum or run
analysis on more than three dimensions.

This library presently depends heavily on core.matrix and to a lesser extent,
incanter.
